## üìä Datasets

The application uses two primary healthcare datasets:

### Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
- Features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass
- Includes cell characteristics like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness
- Binary classification: Malignant (M) or Benign (B)

### Diabetes Dataset
- Diagnostic measurements for diabetes prediction
- Includes glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI
- Binary classification: Diabetes positive (1) or negative (0)

## ü§ñ Models

The application supports the following machine learning models:

- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model suitable for binary classification in medical contexts
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees offering robust performance for complex relationships
- **Gradient Boosting**: Advanced ensemble method with often superior performance for medical predictions

Each model can be customized with different hyperparameters through the UI.

## üìä SHAP Visualizations

The application provides sophisticated SHAP-based visualizations:

- **Summary Plots**: Show how each feature impacts predictions across multiple patients
- **Bar Plots**: Rank features by their global importance to the model
- **Waterfall Plots**: Explain individual patient predictions by showing each feature's contribution
- **Force Plots**: Visualize the push/pull effect of features on a specific medical prediction

These visualizations help medical professionals understand not just what the model predicts, but why it makes specific predictions.
